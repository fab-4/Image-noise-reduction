# Image-noise-reduction
 Noise reduction in image is necessary to maintain the quality of images. Noise is added into an image at the time of image acquisition (or) image capturing. After capturing, image preprocessing is necessarily done to correct and adjust the image for further classification and segmentation. From the literature study different filtering techniques are available to reduce the noise from the images. Normally the filters are used to improve the image quality, suppress the noise. Here we proposes median filtering technique for removing salt & pepper noise from images. Several examples were conducted to evaluate the performance of the median filter on noise.
